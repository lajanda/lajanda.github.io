<h1>Write for freedom</h1>
    <h2>An event to show support to political prisoners wrongfully held in Russia</h2>

    <h4>Join us for an evening of letter-writing! Together we can write letters of 
      hope and kindness to people who have been imprisoned for their convictions. </h4>
  </div>
  
<p><b>WHEN:</b> April 24, 2025 at 18:00 CET</p>
  <p><b>WHERE:</b> <a href="https://tromso.kommune.no/bibliotek">Tromsø library</a>: meeting room</p>
<div align="center">
  <h4>It's easy to do and we will help you!</h4>
  <h4>It's a small thing that can make a big difference.</h4>
  <h4>And like many of the best things in life: It's free.</h4>
</div> 
<br>
 <h3>Here's how it works:</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Bring a device -- a laptop, ipad, smartphone.</b> 
    You can connect to the Tromsø guest free wifi at the library.</li>
    <li><b></b>Go to</b> <a href="https://letters-now.org/search/">Letters-now</a> 
      <b>to select a prisoner to write to.</b> You can expand the filters to select a 
    prisoner according to various parameters such as: age, occupation, marital status, 
    hobby, etc. Alternatively, you can choose a prisoner from 
      <a href="https://memorial-france.org/prisonniere-s-politiques/">Memorial-France</a> 
      (note that this site is in French). </li>
    <li><b>Write your letter.</b> It is best to start with a short paragraph 
      introducing yourself.
    Then you can add a narrative about something of interest to you, 
      for example you can describe a book you read, a movie you saw, your pet, etc. 
      You can close out your letter by saying that you are writing to support them, 
      that you respect and value them and care about what happens to them. 
      (There are also things that you should not write about -- see FAQs below.)</li>
    <li><b>If you have written your letter in a language other than Russian, use 
      googletranslate or AI to translate your letter.</b> We can check the translation
    for accuracy.</li>
    <li><b>Paste your letter into the window on the website.</b> The site 
      will accept up to 2400 characters (including spaces). </li>
    <li><b>State your email address.</b> If the prisoner writes back to you, 
    the response will be mailed to you at that address.</li>
    <li><b>Do you give permission to publish your letter 
    anonymously?</b> Click on your answer.</li>
    <li><b>Click on Send the letter!</b></li>
    <li><b>Thank you!</b> You have reached out to give hope and encouragement
    to someone who is suffering unjustly.</li>
  </ul>

       <h3>Here are some examples of people that you can write to:</h3>

        <table width="900" border="0">
            <tr>
                <td width="500"><b>Irina Navalnaya</b>, an IT specialist, 
                  is 27 years old, a citizen of Ukraine. 
  When she and her mother evacuated from their home in Mariupol at the beginning 
  of the full-scale war, they were interrogated by 
  the Russian police who harassed Irina because of her last name 
  (by chance the same as that of Aleksei Navalny) 
  and even put a gun to her head. 
  A few months later she returned to check on her grandmother 
  and collect some of her belongings. She was arrested 
  while riding her bicycle and taken to the police department 
  where she was beaten. After a month of torture at an undisclosed location, 
  to save her life she “confessed” to planning a terrorist attack. 
  Memorial considers the case against her to be a fabrication. 
  She is now serving an 8-year sentence in a penal colony 
  not far from Rostov-on-Don, Russia.

         <table width="900" border="0">
            <tr>
            <td width="400"><img src="Gorinov.jpg" width="197" height="280" /></td>
 
              <td width="500"><b>Aleksei Gorinov</b> is 63, a Moscow lawyer 
                  who was arrested in April 2022 for suggesting at a council of 
                  deputies that it was inappropriate to organize a children’s dance 
                  and drawing competition when children are dying in Ukraine. 
                  From his cage at the back of the court during his trial he held 
                  up a poster saying, “Do you still need this war?”. He received a 
                  7-year sentence. In November 2024 Aleksei was on trial again, 
                  this time for allegedly “advocating terrorism”, and three more years 
                  were added to his sentence. During that trial he held up a poster saying, 
                  “Enough killing. Let’s stop the war.” Aleksei is currently being held 
                  in a penal colony 180 kilometers east of Moscow, where Memorial believes 
                  he is being tortured.

  <p>FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>How do we know that these people are political prisoners?</b> 
      Both websites cited above are run by human rights defence organizations with 
    legal experts who have evaluated the cases and determined that these 
    individuals are being politically persecuted for non-violent actions. </li>
    <li><b>What are things that I should not write about?</b> Because your letter will 
    be read by a censor, there are several things it is best to avoid, such as: 
    criticism of political issues in Russia and the war in Ukraine, sex,  
    swear words, codes or poems, violence, military, and the legal case 
      of the prisoner. It is also a good idea to avoid food since prisoner 
      fare is quite poor, and descriptions of food might be unpleasant.
