<p><b>WHEN:</b> April 24, 2025 at 18:00 CET</p>

  <h4>It's easy to do and we will help you!</h4>
  <h4>A small thing that can make a big difference.</h4>
  <h4>And like many of the best things in life: It's free.</h4>
</div> 
<br>
 <h3>Here's how it works:</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Bring a device -- a laptop, ipad, smartphone.</b> 
    You can connect to the Tromsø guest free wifi at the library.</li>
    <li><b></b>Go to <a href="https://letters-now.org/search/">Letters-now</a> 
      to select a prisoner to write to.</b> You can expand the filters to select a 
    prisoner according to various parameters such as: age, occupation, marital status, 
    hobby, etc. Alternatively, you can choose a prisoner from 
      <a href="https://memorial-france.org/prisonniere-s-politiques/">Memorial-France</a> 
      (note that this site is in French). </li>
    <li><b>Write your letter.</b> It is best to start with a short paragraph 
      introducing yourself.
    Then you can add a narrative about something of interest to you, 
      for example you can describe a book you read, a movie you saw, your pet, etc. 
      You can close out your letter by saying that you are writing to support them, 
      that you respect and value them and care about what happens to them. 
      (There are also things that you should not write about -- see FAQs below.)</li>
    <li><b>If you have written your letter in a language other than Russian, use 
      googletranslate or AI to translate your letter.</b> We can check the translation
    for you for accuracy.</li>
    <li><b>Paste your letter into the window on the website.</b> The site 
      will accept up to 2400 characters (including spaces). </li>
    <li><b>State your email address.</b> If the prisoner writes back to you, 
    the response will be mailed to you at that address.</li>
    <li>The site also asks you whether you give permission to publish your letter 
    anonymously.</li>
    <li><b>Click on Send the letter!</b></li>
    <li><b>Thank you!</b> You have reached out to give hope and encouragement
    to someone who is suffering unjustly.</li>
