</div> 
<br>
 <h3>Вот как:</h3> 
  <ol>
    <li><b>Возьмите с собой устройство — ноутбук, iPad, смартфон.</b> 
    В библиотеке можно подключиться к бесплатному Wi-Fi Tromsø guest.</li>
    <li><b>Go to</b> <a href="https://letters-now.org/search/">Letters-now</a> 
      <b>to select a prisoner to write to.</b> You can expand the filters to select a 
    prisoner according to various parameters such as: age, occupation, marital status, 
    hobby, etc. If you have a hard time choosing, you can scroll down to 
    "Lifeline" toward the bottom of the page and you will be assigned 
    a prisoner at random. Alternatively, you can choose a prisoner from 
      <a href="https://memorial-france.org/prisonniere-s-politiques/">Memorial-France</a> 
      (note that this site is in French). </li>
    <li><b>Write your letter.</b> It is best to start with a short paragraph 
      introducing yourself.
    Then you can add a narrative about something of interest to you, 
      for example you can describe a book you read, a movie you saw, your pet, etc. 
      You can close out your letter by saying that you are writing to support them, 
      that you respect and value them and care about what happens to them. 
      (There are also things that you should not write about -- see FAQs below.)</li>
    <li><b>If you have written your letter in a language other than Russian, use 
      googletranslate or AI to translate your letter.</b> We can check the translation
    for accuracy.</li>
    <li><b>Paste your letter into the window on the website.</b> The site 
      will accept up to 2400 characters (including spaces). </li>
    <li><b>State your email address.</b> If the prisoner writes back to you, 
    the response will be mailed to you at that address.</li>
    <li><b>Do you give permission to publish your letter 
    anonymously?</b> Click on your answer.</li>
    <li><b>Click on:</b> Send the letter!</li>
    <li><b>Thank you!</b> You have reached out to give hope and encouragement
    to someone who is suffering unjustly.</li>
  </ol>

       <h3>Here are some examples of people that you can write to:</h3>

        <table width="900" border="0">
            <tr>
                <td width="500"><b>Irina Navalnaya</b>, an IT specialist, 
                  is 27 years old, a citizen of Ukraine. 
  When she and her mother evacuated from their home in Mariupol at the beginning 
  of the full-scale war, they were interrogated by 
  the Russian police who harassed Irina because of her last name 
  (by chance the same as that of Aleksei Navalny) 
  and even put a gun to her head. 
  A few months later she returned to check on her grandmother 
  and collect some of her belongings. She was arrested 
  while riding her bicycle and taken to the police department 
  where she was beaten. After a month of torture at an undisclosed location, 
  to save her life she “confessed” to planning a terrorist attack. 
  Memorial considers the case against her to be a fabrication. 
  She is now serving an 8-year sentence in a penal colony 
  not far from Rostov-on-Don, Russia.

            <tr>
            <td width="300"><img src="Gorinov.jpeg" width="197" height="280" /></td>
 
              <td width="500"><b>Aleksei Gorinov</b> is 63, a Moscow lawyer 
                  who was arrested in April 2022 for suggesting at a council of 
                  deputies that it was inappropriate to organize a children’s dance 
                  and drawing competition when children are dying in Ukraine. 
                  From his cage at the back of the court during his trial he held 
                  up a poster saying, “Do you still need this war?”. He received a 
                  7-year sentence. In November 2024 Aleksei was on trial again, 
                  this time for allegedly “advocating terrorism”, and three more years 
                  were added to his sentence. During that trial he held up a poster saying, 
                  “Enough killing. Let’s stop the war.” Aleksei is currently being held 
                  in a penal colony 180 kilometers east of Moscow, where Memorial believes 
                  he is being tortured.

  <p>FAQs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>How do we know that these people are political prisoners?</b> 
      Both websites cited above are run by human rights defence organizations with 
    legal experts who have evaluated the cases and determined that these 
    individuals are being politically persecuted for non-violent actions. </li>
    <li><b>What are things that I should not write about?</b> Поскольку ваше письмо будет
прочитано цензором, есть несколько вещей, которых лучше избегать, например:
критика политической ситуации в России и войны на Украине, секс,
нецензурные слова, секретные коды или стихи, насилие, армия и судебное дело
заключенного. Также хорошей идеей будет не писать о еде, поскольку тюремная

пища довольно скудная, а описания еды могут быть неприятными.
