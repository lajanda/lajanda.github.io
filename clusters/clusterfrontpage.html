<h1>Cluster Types for Russian Verbs</h1>
<h3>Laura Janda and John Korba</h3>
<p>This page contains links to lists of the aspectual clusters for the verbs in <i>Nachalo</i> Books 1 & 2 and <i>V puti</i>. The goal of this database is to represent the main features of the Russian cluster system. Neither the clusters nor the glosses are intended to be definitive or exhaustive. The representations here are fairly conservative, including only verbs that most Russians would not find strange or unusual. For definitions of "Natural Perfective", "Specialized Perfective", "Complex Act Perfective" and "Single Act Perfective", see notes at the bottom of this page.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The links to the Cluster Reports lead to Adobe Acrobat Files. In order to view them properly and search using cyrillic, one needs to install the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader (8.0 or above), which is available for free at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/">this link</a>.
<p><b>HOW TO SEARCH THE CLUSTER REPORTS:</b> Once a cluster report is opened, you may search for any verb (or any combination of letters contained in any verb) by pressing CTRL+F and inserting the cyrillic letters you want to search. 
<h2>The Cluster Reports</h2>
<p><font size=+1><a href="CLUSTERS_ALL.pdf">Complete Pedagogical Database (234 KB)</a></font size> This database lists all 266 verb clusters in the database. The clusters are appear in alphabetical order according to the Activity verb on which each is based. If there are two Activity verbs, as in the case of the motion verbs, the Non-determined stem was used for alphabetization. There is one cluster that lacks an Activity verb -- it is alphabetized according to its Natural Perfective, &#1089;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1086;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100;&#1089;&#1103;. 
<p>The remaining reports list subsets of the database, according to the cluster structure types. Within each report, the clusters appear in alphabetical order according to the Activity verb on which each is based.

<p><h2>Definitions:</h2>
<p>Natural Perfective – This is the Perfective that is the natural culmination of an Imperfective Activity, equivalent to the Perfective “partner” in the pair model. The Perfectives &#1089;&#1099;&#1075;&#1088;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; ‘play’ and &#1089;&#1087;&#1077;&#1090;&#1100; ‘sing’ are Natural Perfectives. A few Natural Perfectives, like &#1091;&#1089;&#1083;&#1099;&#1096;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; ‘hear’, describe a sudden attainment. Natural Perfectives do not normally have secondary Imperfectives.
<p>Specialized Perfective – This type of Perfective is present when a prefix adds new information, usually motivating the derivation of a secondary Imperfective, as we see with &#1074;&#1099;&#1080;&#1075;&#1088;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; ‘win’ and &#1087;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1088;&#1072;&#1073;&#1086;&#1090;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; ‘revise’. When we say that a cluster contains a Specialized Perfective, this means that there may be one or more Specialized Perfectives, along with any secondary Imperfectives and Complex Act Perfectives derivable from the secondary Imperfective(s).
<p>Complex Act Perfective – This type of Perfective combines an Activity with a limit on its beginning, ending, or duration. The prefixes most commonly used to build Complex Act Perfectives are  &#1087;&#1086;- ‘for a while’, &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;- ‘for a certain duration’, &#1079;&#1072;- ‘begin’, and &#1086;&#1090;- ‘stop’. Some examples are &#1087;&#1086;&#1080;&#1075;&#1088;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; ‘play for a while’, &#1079;&#1072;&#1087;&#1077;&#1090;&#1100; ‘begin to sing’, &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1088;&#1072;&#1073;&#1086;&#1090;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; ‘work for a certain duration’,  &#1086;&#1090;&#1088;&#1072;&#1073;&#1086;&#1090;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; ‘work and then stop after a certain duration’. It is generally not possible to derive a secondary Imperfective from a Complex Act Perfective.
<p>Single Act Perfective – This type of Perfective tells us that only a single act was performed, extracted from an Activity made up of conceptually identical repeated units. An example is &#1095;&#1080;&#1093;&#1085;&#1091;&#1090;&#1100;  ‘sneeze once’, since  &#1095;&#1080;&#1093;a&#1090;&#1100; ‘sneeze’ is an Activity composed of identical units. Most Single Act Perfectives contain the suffix &ndash;&#1085;&#1091;, but motion verbs  can use prefixes for this purpose, as in  &#1089;&#1093;&#1086;&#1076;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100; ‘walk someplace and back once’. It is generally not possible to derive a secondary Imperfective from a Single Act Perfective.
